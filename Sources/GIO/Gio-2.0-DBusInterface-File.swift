///
/// A `GDatagramBased` is a networking interface for representing datagram-based

/// `GSocket`, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
/// 
/// `GDatagramBased` is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
/// alongside higher-level networking APIs such as `GIOStream`.
/// 
/// It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
/// to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
/// the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
/// or system calls. For example, `GSocket` uses `recvmmsg()` and `sendmmsg()` where
/// possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
/// multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
/// assemble or disassemble a message.
/// 
/// Each `GDatagramBased` operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
/// for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
/// timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
/// error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
/// `G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK` error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
/// will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
/// timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
/// `G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT` if no progress was made. To know when a call would
/// successfully run you can call `g_datagram_based_condition_check()` or
/// `g_datagram_based_condition_wait()`. You can also use
/// `g_datagram_based_create_source()` and attach it to a `GMainContext` to get
/// callbacks when I/O is possible.
/// 
/// When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to

/// The `FileProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GFile` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `File`.
/// Alternatively, use `FileRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// `GFile` is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
/// virtual file system. `GFiles` are lightweight, immutable objects
/// that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
/// `GFile` objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
/// file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
/// (see `GInputStream` and `GOutputStream`).
/// 
/// To construct a `GFile`, you can use:
/// - `g_file_new_for_path()` if you have a path.
/// - `g_file_new_for_uri()` if you have a URI.
/// - `g_file_new_for_commandline_arg()` for a command line argument.
/// - `g_file_new_tmp()` to create a temporary file from a template.
/// - `g_file_parse_name()` from a UTF-8 string gotten from `g_file_get_parse_name()`.
/// - `g_file_new_build_filename()` to create a file from path elements.
/// 
/// One way to think of a `GFile` is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
/// normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
/// `GFiles` are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
/// to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
/// 
/// `GFiles` make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
/// the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
/// `GFile` using `g_file_get_parent()` to get an identifier for the parent
/// directory, `g_file_get_child()` to get a child within a directory,
/// `g_file_resolve_relative_path()` to resolve a relative path between two
/// `GFiles`. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not end up at
/// the same root if you repeatedly call `g_file_get_parent()` on two different
/// files.
/// 
/// All `GFiles` have a basename (get with `g_file_get_basename()`). These names
/// are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
/// (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
/// have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
/// you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
/// name that you can get by requesting the
/// `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME` attribute with `g_file_query_info()`.
/// This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be used in a user interface.
/// But always store the real basename or the `GFile` to use to actually
/// access the file, because there is no way to go from a display name to
/// the actual name.
/// 
/// Using `GFile` as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
/// in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
/// hard or soft links may cause two different `GFiles` to refer to the same
/// file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
/// short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
/// check if two `GFiles` point to the same file you can query for the
/// `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE` attribute. Note that `GFile` does some trivial
/// canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
/// the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
/// path, "." or ".." path segments, etc) does not create different `GFiles`.
/// 
/// Many `GFile` operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
/// to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
/// simply have `_async()` appended to their function names. The asynchronous
/// I/O functions call a `GAsyncReadyCallback` which is then used to finalize
/// the operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the
/// function's matching `_finish()` operation.
/// 
/// It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
/// shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
/// I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
/// Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the

/// The `ActionProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GAction` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.

/// Alternatively, use `ActionRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// `GAction` represents a single named action.
/// 
/// The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
/// `g_action_activate()`.  This results in the 'activate' signal being
/// emitted.  An activation has a `GVariant` parameter (which may be
/// `nil`).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
/// parameter type (which is given at construction time).
/// 
/// An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
/// set with `g_action_change_state()`.  This call takes a `GVariant`.  The
/// correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
/// (which is given at construction time).
/// 
/// The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
/// range.
/// 
/// `GAction` is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as

/// signals when these change.  The implementor is responsible for filtering
/// calls to `g_action_activate()` and `g_action_change_state()` for type

/// only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
/// compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
/// is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.

/// passed unmodified to the application.
/// 
/// Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped

/// implements the `GVfs` extension point). As such, if the application
/// needs to examine the URI, it needs to use `g_file_get_uri()` or
/// similar on `GFile`. In other words, an application cannot assume
/// that the URI passed to e.g. `g_file_new_for_commandline_arg()` is
/// equal to the result of `g_file_get_uri()`. The following snippet
/// illustrates this:
/// 
/// ```
/// GFile *f;

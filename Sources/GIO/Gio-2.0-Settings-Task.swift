// MARK: - Settings Class

/// The `SettingsProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GSettings` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `Settings`.
/// Alternatively, use `SettingsRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// The `GSettings` class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
/// application settings.
/// 
/// Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
/// settings with `GSettings` is typically extremely fast: on
/// approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
/// `GHashTable` lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
/// of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
/// for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
/// (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
/// case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
/// a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
/// even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
/// only ever modify `GSettings` keys in response to explicit user action.
/// Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
/// made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
/// of preferences widgets.  The built-in `g_settings_bind()` functionality
/// is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
/// result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
/// 
/// When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
/// that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
/// values, as well as some other information.
/// 
/// Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
/// are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
/// can also be '[relocatable](#gsettings-relocatable)', i.e. not equipped with
/// a fixed path. This is
/// useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
/// able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
/// 
/// Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
/// and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
/// be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
/// library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
/// "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
/// Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
/// they often did in GConf.
/// 
/// Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
/// restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
/// values as `GVariant`, and allows any `GVariantType` for keys. Key names
/// are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
/// the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
/// with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
/// 
/// Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
/// localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
/// and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
/// `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
/// elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
/// the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
/// the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
/// 
/// The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
/// [locale category for
/// translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html`index`-locale-categories-1).
/// The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
/// translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
/// XML comment immediately above the <default> element â€” it is recommended to
/// add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
/// implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
/// attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
/// defaults which use the same string.
/// 
/// For example:
/// ```
///  <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
/// ```
/// 
/// Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
/// `GVariants` (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
/// errors will occur.
/// 
/// GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
/// by the [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas)
/// utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
/// 
/// A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
/// [gschema.dtd](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/gschema.dtd)
/// 
/// The [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas) tool expects schema
/// files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
/// 
/// At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
/// id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
/// ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
/// e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
/// for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
/// and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
/// associated with one named application, the id should not use
/// StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
/// 
/// In addition to `GVariant` types, keys can have types that have
/// enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
/// <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
/// [example](#schema-enumerated). The underlying type of such a key
/// is string, but you can use `g_settings_get_enum()`, `g_settings_set_enum()`,
/// `g_settings_get_flags()`, `g_settings_set_flags()` access the numeric values
/// corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
/// 
/// An example for default value:
/// ```
/// <schemalist>
///   <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
/// 
///     <key name="greeting" type="s">
///       <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
///       <summary>A greeting</summary>
///       <description>
///         Greeting of the invading martians
///       </description>
///     </key>
/// 
///     <key name="box" type="(ii)">
///       <default>(20,30)</default>
///     </key>
/// 
///     <key name="empty-string" type="s">
///       <default>""</default>
///       <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
///     </key>
/// 
///   </schema>
/// </schemalist>
/// ```
/// 
/// An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
/// ```

///     <value nick="first" value="1"/>
///     <value nick="second" value="2"/>

///     <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
///   </flags>
/// 
///   <schema id="org.gtk.Test">

///       <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
///     </key>
///   </schema>
/// </schemalist>
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Vendor overrides
/// 
/// Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
/// an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
/// to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
/// is inconvenient and error-prone,
/// [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas) reads so-called vendor
/// override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
/// schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
/// as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
/// serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
/// ```
///     [org.gtk.Example]
///     key1='string'
///     key2=1.5
/// ```
/// 
/// glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
/// `.gschema.override`.
/// 
/// ## Binding
/// 
/// A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind `GObject` properties
/// directly to settings, using `g_settings_bind()`. Once a GObject property
/// has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
/// propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
/// between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
/// 
/// This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
/// underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
/// looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
/// automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
/// If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
/// `G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY` flag.
/// 
/// ## Relocatable schemas # <a name="gsettings-relocatable"></a>
/// 
/// A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
/// <schema> element. By using `g_settings_new_with_path()`, a `GSettings` object
/// can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
/// instance. Paths passed to `g_settings_new_with_path()` will typically be
/// constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
/// identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
/// be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
/// dependency library.
/// 
/// For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
/// for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
/// `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
/// `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
/// `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
/// they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
/// ```
/// <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
///   <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
/// </schema>
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Build system integration # <a name="gsettings-build-system"></a>
/// 
/// GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
/// installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
/// following to your `configure.ac`:
/// ```
/// GLIB_GSETTINGS
/// ```
/// 
/// In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
/// install the named schema:
/// ```
/// gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
/// 
/// @GSETTINGS_RULES@
/// ```
/// 
/// No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
/// translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
/// be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
/// 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
/// ```
/// data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// ```
/// 
/// Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
/// ```
/// [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// ```
/// 
/// GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
/// <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
/// attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
/// by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
/// `.gschema.xml.in` template.
/// 
/// If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
/// schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
/// schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
/// approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
/// synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
/// ```
/// gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
/// gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
/// ```
/// 
/// `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
/// which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
/// `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
/// automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
/// rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
/// `EXTRA_DIST`.

/// The `Settings` type acts as a reference-counted owner of an underlying `GSettings` instance.
/// It provides the methods that can operate on this data type through `SettingsProtocol` conformance.
/// Use `Settings` as a strong reference or owner of a `GSettings` instance.
///
/// The `GSettings` class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
/// application settings.
/// 
/// Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
/// settings with `GSettings` is typically extremely fast: on
/// approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
/// `GHashTable` lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
/// of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
/// for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
/// (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
/// case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
/// a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
/// even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
/// only ever modify `GSettings` keys in response to explicit user action.
/// Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
/// made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
/// of preferences widgets.  The built-in `g_settings_bind()` functionality
/// is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
/// result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
/// 
/// When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
/// that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
/// values, as well as some other information.
/// 
/// Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
/// are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
/// can also be '[relocatable](#gsettings-relocatable)', i.e. not equipped with
/// a fixed path. This is
/// useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
/// able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
/// 
/// Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
/// and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
/// be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
/// library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
/// "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
/// Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
/// they often did in GConf.
/// 
/// Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
/// restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
/// values as `GVariant`, and allows any `GVariantType` for keys. Key names
/// are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
/// the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
/// with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
/// 
/// Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
/// localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
/// and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
/// `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
/// elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
/// the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
/// the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
/// 
/// The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
/// [locale category for
/// translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html`index`-locale-categories-1).
/// The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
/// translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
/// XML comment immediately above the <default> element â€” it is recommended to
/// add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
/// implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
/// attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
/// defaults which use the same string.
/// 
/// For example:
/// ```
///  <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
/// ```
/// 
/// Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
/// `GVariants` (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
/// errors will occur.
/// 
/// GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
/// by the [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas)
/// utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
/// 
/// A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
/// [gschema.dtd](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/gschema.dtd)
/// 
/// The [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas) tool expects schema
/// files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
/// 
/// At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
/// id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
/// ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
/// e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
/// for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
/// and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
/// associated with one named application, the id should not use
/// StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
/// 
/// In addition to `GVariant` types, keys can have types that have
/// enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
/// <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
/// [example](#schema-enumerated). The underlying type of such a key
/// is string, but you can use `g_settings_get_enum()`, `g_settings_set_enum()`,
/// `g_settings_get_flags()`, `g_settings_set_flags()` access the numeric values
/// corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
/// 
/// An example for default value:
/// ```
/// <schemalist>
///   <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
/// 
///     <key name="greeting" type="s">
///       <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
///       <summary>A greeting</summary>
///       <description>
///         Greeting of the invading martians
///       </description>
///     </key>
/// 
///     <key name="box" type="(ii)">
///       <default>(20,30)</default>
///     </key>
/// 
///     <key name="empty-string" type="s">
///       <default>""</default>
///       <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
///     </key>
/// 
///   </schema>
/// </schemalist>
/// ```
///

/// ```

///   <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
///     <value nick="first" value="1"/>

///   </flags>
/// 
///   <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
/// 
///     <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
///       <range min="1" max="100"/>

///       <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
///     </key>
///   </schema>
/// </schemalist>
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Vendor overrides
/// 
/// Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
/// an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
/// to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
/// is inconvenient and error-prone,
/// [glib-compile-schemas](#glib-compile-schemas) reads so-called vendor
/// override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
/// schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
/// as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
/// serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
/// ```
///     [org.gtk.Example]
///     key1='string'
///     key2=1.5
/// ```
/// 
/// glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
/// `.gschema.override`.
/// 
/// ## Binding
/// 
/// A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind `GObject` properties
/// directly to settings, using `g_settings_bind()`. Once a GObject property
/// has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
/// propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
/// between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
/// 
/// This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
/// underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
/// looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
/// automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
/// If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
/// `G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY` flag.
/// 
/// ## Relocatable schemas # <a name="gsettings-relocatable"></a>
/// 
/// A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
/// <schema> element. By using `g_settings_new_with_path()`, a `GSettings` object
/// can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
/// instance. Paths passed to `g_settings_new_with_path()` will typically be
/// constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
/// identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
/// be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
/// dependency library.
/// 
/// For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
/// for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
/// `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
/// `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
/// `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
/// they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
/// ```
/// <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
///   <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
/// </schema>
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Build system integration # <a name="gsettings-build-system"></a>
/// 
/// GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
/// installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
/// following to your `configure.ac`:
/// ```
/// GLIB_GSETTINGS
/// ```
/// 
/// In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
/// install the named schema:
/// ```
/// gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
/// 
/// @GSETTINGS_RULES@
/// ```
/// 
/// No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
/// translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
/// be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
/// 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
/// ```
/// data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// ```
/// 
/// Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
/// ```
/// [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
/// ```
/// 
/// GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
/// <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
/// attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
/// by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
/// `.gschema.xml.in` template.
/// 
/// If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
/// schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
/// schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
/// approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
/// synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
/// ```
/// gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
/// gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
/// ```
/// 
/// `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
/// which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
/// `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
/// automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
/// rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
/// `EXTRA_DIST`.

/// As of GLib 2.46, `GSimpleAsyncResult` is deprecated in favor of

/// 
/// `GSimpleAsyncResult` implements `GAsyncResult`.
/// 
/// GSimpleAsyncResult handles `GAsyncReadyCallbacks`, error
/// reporting, operation cancellation and the final state of an operation,
/// completely transparent to the application. Results can be returned
/// as a pointer e.g. for functions that return data that is collected
/// asynchronously, a boolean value for checking the success or failure
/// of an operation, or a `gssize` for operations which return the number
/// of bytes modified by the operation; all of the simple return cases
/// are covered.
/// 
/// Most of the time, an application will not need to know of the details
/// of this API; it is handled transparently, and any necessary operations
/// are handled by `GAsyncResult`'s interface. However, if implementing a
/// new GIO module, for writing language bindings, or for complex
/// applications that need better control of how asynchronous operations
/// are completed, it is important to understand this functionality.
/// 
/// GSimpleAsyncResults are tagged with the calling function to ensure
/// that asynchronous functions and their finishing functions are used
/// together correctly.
/// 
/// To create a new `GSimpleAsyncResult`, call `g_simple_async_result_new()`.
/// If the result needs to be created for a `GError`, use
/// `g_simple_async_result_new_from_error()` or
/// `g_simple_async_result_new_take_error()`. If a `GError` is not available
/// (e.g. the asynchronous operation's doesn't take a `GError` argument),
/// but the result still needs to be created for an error condition, use
/// `g_simple_async_result_new_error()` (or `g_simple_async_result_set_error_va()`
/// if your application or binding requires passing a variable argument list
/// directly), and the error can then be propagated through the use of
/// `g_simple_async_result_propagate_error()`.
/// 
/// An asynchronous operation can be made to ignore a cancellation event by
/// calling `g_simple_async_result_set_handle_cancellation()` with a
/// `GSimpleAsyncResult` for the operation and `false`. This is useful for
/// operations that are dangerous to cancel, such as close (which would
/// cause a leak if cancelled before being run).
/// 
/// GSimpleAsyncResult can integrate into GLib's event loop, `GMainLoop`,
/// or it can use `GThreads`.
/// `g_simple_async_result_complete()` will finish an I/O task directly
/// from the point where it is called. `g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle()`
/// will finish it from an idle handler in the
/// [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// where the `GSimpleAsyncResult` was created.
/// `g_simple_async_result_run_in_thread()` will run the job in a
/// separate thread and then use
/// `g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle()` to deliver the result.
/// 
/// To set the results of an asynchronous function,
/// `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer()`,
/// `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gboolean()`, and
/// `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gssize()`
/// are provided, setting the operation's result to a gpointer, gboolean, or
/// gssize, respectively.
/// 
/// Likewise, to get the result of an asynchronous function,
/// `g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gpointer()`,
/// `g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gboolean()`, and
/// `g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gssize()` are
/// provided, getting the operation's result as a gpointer, gboolean, and
/// gssize, respectively.
/// 
/// For the details of the requirements implementations must respect, see
/// `GAsyncResult`.  A typical implementation of an asynchronous operation
/// using GSimpleAsyncResult looks something like this:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// baked_cb (Cake    *cake,
///           gpointer user_data)

// MARK: - Task Class

/// The `TaskProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GTask` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `Task`.
/// Alternatively, use `TaskRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// A `GTask` represents and manages a cancellable "task".
/// 
/// ## Asynchronous operations
/// 
/// The most common usage of `GTask` is as a `GAsyncResult`, to
/// manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
/// `g_task_new()` in the "start" method, followed by
/// `g_task_set_task_data()` and the like if you need to keep some
/// additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
/// task object around through your asynchronous operation.
/// Eventually, you will call a method such as
/// `g_task_return_pointer()` or `g_task_return_error()`, which will
/// save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
/// function in the
/// [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
/// loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the `GTask` back to
/// the operation's finish function (as a `GAsyncResult`), and you can
/// use `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like to extract the
/// return value.
/// 
/// Here is an example for using GTask as a GAsyncResult:
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
///     typedef struct {
///       CakeFrostingType frosting;
///       char *message;

/// ## Chained asynchronous operations
/// 
/// `GTask` also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that
/// internally chain together several smaller asynchronous
/// operations. `g_task_get_cancellable()`, `g_task_get_context()`,
/// and `g_task_get_priority()` allow you to get back the task's
/// `GCancellable`, `GMainContext`, and [I/O priority](#io-priority)
/// when starting a new subtask, so you don't have to keep track
/// of them yourself. `g_task_attach_source()` simplifies the case
/// of waiting for a source to fire (automatically using the correct
/// `GMainContext` and priority).
/// 
/// Here is an example for chained asynchronous operations:
///   
/// (C Language Example):

/// ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
/// 
/// `GTask`'s API attempts to be simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult`'s
/// in several ways:
/// - You can save task-specific data with `g_task_set_task_data()`, and
///   retrieve it later with `g_task_get_task_data()`. This replaces the
///   abuse of `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer()` for the same
///   purpose with `GSimpleAsyncResult`.
/// - In addition to the task data, `GTask` also keeps track of the
///   [priority](#io-priority), `GCancellable`, and
///   `GMainContext` associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
///   a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
///   to those values when starting each sub-task.
/// - `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` provides simplified
///   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
///   overrides any other `GTask` return value by default, like
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` does when
///   `g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable()` is called.
///   (You can use `g_task_set_check_cancellable()` to turn off that
///   behavior.) On the other hand, `g_task_run_in_thread()`
///   guarantees that it will always run your
///   `task_func`, even if the task's `GCancellable`
///   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
///   you can start your `task_func` with a
///   `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` check if you need the
///   old behavior.
/// - The "return" methods (eg, `g_task_return_pointer()`)
///   automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
///   there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
///   in idle" distinction. (`GTask` automatically figures out
///   whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
///   if it needs to be sent to another `GMainContext`, or delayed
///   until the next iteration of the current `GMainContext`.)
/// - The "finish" functions for `GTask` based operations are generally
///   much simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult` ones, normally consisting
///   of only a single call to `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like.
///   Since `g_task_propagate_pointer()` "steals" the return value from
///   the `GTask`, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
///   prevent it from being freed twice.
/// - With `GSimpleAsyncResult`, it was common to call
///   `g_simple_async_result_propagate_error()` from the
///   ``_finish()`` wrapper function, and have
///   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
///   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
///   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
///   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
///   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
///   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
///   Note that wrapper methods can now use
///   `g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error()` to do old-style
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` error-returning behavior, and
///   `g_async_result_is_tagged()` to check if a result is tagged as
///   having come from the ``_async()`` wrapper
///   function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
///   0 to `g_input_stream_read_async()`).
public protocol TaskProtocol: ObjectProtocol, AsyncResultProtocol {
        /// Untyped pointer to the underlying `GTask` instance.
    var ptr: UnsafeMutableRawPointer { get }

    /// Typed pointer to the underlying `GTask` instance.
    var task_ptr: UnsafeMutablePointer<GTask> { get }
}

/// The `TaskRef` type acts as a lightweight Swift reference to an underlying `GTask` instance.
/// It exposes methods that can operate on this data type through `TaskProtocol` conformance.
/// Use `TaskRef` only as an `unowned` reference to an existing `GTask` instance.
///
/// A `GTask` represents and manages a cancellable "task".
/// 
/// ## Asynchronous operations
/// 
/// The most common usage of `GTask` is as a `GAsyncResult`, to
/// manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
/// `g_task_new()` in the "start" method, followed by
/// `g_task_set_task_data()` and the like if you need to keep some
/// additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
/// task object around through your asynchronous operation.
/// Eventually, you will call a method such as
/// `g_task_return_pointer()` or `g_task_return_error()`, which will
/// save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
/// function in the
/// [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
/// loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the `GTask` back to
/// the operation's finish function (as a `GAsyncResult`), and you can
/// use `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like to extract the
/// return value.
/// 
/// Here is an example for using GTask as a GAsyncResult:
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
///     typedef struct {
///       CakeFrostingType frosting;
///       char *message;

/// ## Chained asynchronous operations
/// 
/// `GTask` also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that
/// internally chain together several smaller asynchronous
/// operations. `g_task_get_cancellable()`, `g_task_get_context()`,
/// and `g_task_get_priority()` allow you to get back the task's
/// `GCancellable`, `GMainContext`, and [I/O priority](#io-priority)
/// when starting a new subtask, so you don't have to keep track
/// of them yourself. `g_task_attach_source()` simplifies the case
/// of waiting for a source to fire (automatically using the correct
/// `GMainContext` and priority).
///

/// passing `true`, then if the task's `GCancellable` is cancelled,
/// it will return control back to the caller immediately, while
/// allowing the task thread to continue running in the background
/// (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
/// Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
/// locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
/// to make "GLib-friendly" asynchronous and cancellable
/// synchronous variants of blocking APIs.

/// ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
/// 
/// `GTask`'s API attempts to be simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult`'s
/// in several ways:
/// - You can save task-specific data with `g_task_set_task_data()`, and
///   retrieve it later with `g_task_get_task_data()`. This replaces the
///   abuse of `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer()` for the same
///   purpose with `GSimpleAsyncResult`.
/// - In addition to the task data, `GTask` also keeps track of the
///   [priority](#io-priority), `GCancellable`, and
///   `GMainContext` associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
///   a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
///   to those values when starting each sub-task.
/// - `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` provides simplified
///   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
///   overrides any other `GTask` return value by default, like
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` does when
///   `g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable()` is called.
///   (You can use `g_task_set_check_cancellable()` to turn off that
///   behavior.) On the other hand, `g_task_run_in_thread()`
///   guarantees that it will always run your
///   `task_func`, even if the task's `GCancellable`
///   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
///   you can start your `task_func` with a
///   `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` check if you need the
///   old behavior.
/// - The "return" methods (eg, `g_task_return_pointer()`)
///   automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
///   there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
///   in idle" distinction. (`GTask` automatically figures out
///   whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
///   if it needs to be sent to another `GMainContext`, or delayed
///   until the next iteration of the current `GMainContext`.)
/// - The "finish" functions for `GTask` based operations are generally
///   much simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult` ones, normally consisting
///   of only a single call to `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like.
///   Since `g_task_propagate_pointer()` "steals" the return value from
///   the `GTask`, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
///   prevent it from being freed twice.
/// - With `GSimpleAsyncResult`, it was common to call
///   `g_simple_async_result_propagate_error()` from the
///   ``_finish()`` wrapper function, and have
///   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
///   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
///   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
///   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
///   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
///   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
///   Note that wrapper methods can now use
///   `g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error()` to do old-style
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` error-returning behavior, and
///   `g_async_result_is_tagged()` to check if a result is tagged as
///   having come from the ``_async()`` wrapper
///   function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
///   0 to `g_input_stream_read_async()`).

///
/// A `GTask` represents and manages a cancellable "task".
/// 
/// ## Asynchronous operations
/// 
/// The most common usage of `GTask` is as a `GAsyncResult`, to
/// manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
/// `g_task_new()` in the "start" method, followed by
/// `g_task_set_task_data()` and the like if you need to keep some
/// additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
/// task object around through your asynchronous operation.
/// Eventually, you will call a method such as
/// `g_task_return_pointer()` or `g_task_return_error()`, which will
/// save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
/// function in the
/// [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
/// loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the `GTask` back to
/// the operation's finish function (as a `GAsyncResult`), and you can
/// use `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like to extract the
/// return value.

/// (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
/// Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
/// locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
/// to make "GLib-friendly" asynchronous and cancellable
/// synchronous variants of blocking APIs.

/// ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
/// 
/// `GTask`'s API attempts to be simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult`'s
/// in several ways:
/// - You can save task-specific data with `g_task_set_task_data()`, and
///   retrieve it later with `g_task_get_task_data()`. This replaces the
///   abuse of `g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer()` for the same
///   purpose with `GSimpleAsyncResult`.
/// - In addition to the task data, `GTask` also keeps track of the
///   [priority](#io-priority), `GCancellable`, and
///   `GMainContext` associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
///   a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
///   to those values when starting each sub-task.
/// - `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` provides simplified
///   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
///   overrides any other `GTask` return value by default, like
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` does when
///   `g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable()` is called.
///   (You can use `g_task_set_check_cancellable()` to turn off that
///   behavior.) On the other hand, `g_task_run_in_thread()`
///   guarantees that it will always run your
///   `task_func`, even if the task's `GCancellable`
///   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
///   you can start your `task_func` with a
///   `g_task_return_error_if_cancelled()` check if you need the
///   old behavior.
/// - The "return" methods (eg, `g_task_return_pointer()`)
///   automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
///   there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
///   in idle" distinction. (`GTask` automatically figures out
///   whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
///   if it needs to be sent to another `GMainContext`, or delayed
///   until the next iteration of the current `GMainContext`.)
/// - The "finish" functions for `GTask` based operations are generally
///   much simpler than `GSimpleAsyncResult` ones, normally consisting
///   of only a single call to `g_task_propagate_pointer()` or the like.
///   Since `g_task_propagate_pointer()` "steals" the return value from
///   the `GTask`, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
///   prevent it from being freed twice.
/// - With `GSimpleAsyncResult`, it was common to call
///   `g_simple_async_result_propagate_error()` from the
///   ``_finish()`` wrapper function, and have
///   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
///   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
///   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
///   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
///   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
///   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
///   Note that wrapper methods can now use
///   `g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error()` to do old-style
///   `GSimpleAsyncResult` error-returning behavior, and
///   `g_async_result_is_tagged()` to check if a result is tagged as
///   having come from the ``_async()`` wrapper
///   function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
///   0 to `g_input_stream_read_async()`).
